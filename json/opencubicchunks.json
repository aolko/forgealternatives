    "description": "...is a mod allowing you to build pretty much as high or dig as low as you want. It is compatible with many mods, including Optifine with shaders!\r\nWhere this mod excels is in the terrain generation of CustomCubic worldtype, which requires MalisisCore to function. API versions of CC also require the CubicWorldGen submod. Original mod by Robinton (2011). Current mod created by Barteks2x.",
